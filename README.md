# Future Ideas

1. Audio Recording Integration
   - Add a record button to capture audio from multiple sources
   - Integrate web browser capabilities for seamless audio recording from browser tabs
   - Implement audio router passthrough to:
     - Route audio between different applications
     - Record system audio
     - Support virtual audio devices
     - Enable mixing of multiple audio sources in real-time
   - Features could include:
     - Source selection dropdown (microphone, system audio, browser tabs)
     - Audio visualization during recording
     - Basic audio editing capabilities (trim, normalize)
     - Export in multiple formats (MP3, WAV, FLAC)

If you'd like, I can provide detailed examples of how to style the UI, handle errors, or even set up drag-and-drop functionality more comprehensively. Let me know!
